title: Who am I? Why this blog?
---

<img style="float: left;" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/sethalexander/v1487650912/mfrywmsjpeoa8gaf2bkc" width="320" height="320"/> I'm a former hospitality professional working on a career transition by attending Flatiron's online web development boot camp. I got tired of the required nights/weekends/holidays and 55+ hour work week as a salaried manager. I got tired of not seeing my children and making less than I felt my hard work was worth. So I decided to make a change. Web development had come easily to me and I had been teaching myself through free sources, mainly [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com).

Follow along with my journey on this blog. Ask questions and interact. If you find something you like please share. I'll be writing every day that I code, and probably on days I don't as well. In the end, I want to have a true picture of what it will take someone to get through approximately 800 hours of curriculum.

Thanks for coming on this ride with me.
