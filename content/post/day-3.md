Don't think I need to announce what day it is anymore, lol. I think I've got my morning routine down now. Alarms go off at 6 am and I'm out of bed by 6:15 am typically. Coffee is done brewing by the time I get downstairs. Feed the dog and make my coffee (ghee is my only additive right now but I'll get back to Bulletproof Coffee at some point using Brain Octaneâ„¢ Oil). I then do my Daily Limber from [Gymnastic Bodies][1]. Follow that up with some journaling which right now is a version of the [The Five Minute Journal][2] that I have copied into Evernote and added to. I created a template note then duplicate that note every morning and change the title to the date. You can find the template [here][3] if you want to use it. After that I meditate for about 5 minutes. Depending on the day I may walk the dog now or later (I did today because thunderstorms were approaching). This gets me to about 7 am when I start coding until the kids wake up. I think I'll keep this format for now.

Only news from my morning coding session is that it got cut short because of this:
![tornado_warning][4]
It seems like I'm linking a lot of tools lol. If you're wondering how I got that notification from my phone on my computer it's an app called [Pushbullet][5].
