      <title>One Way To Pair Program</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight a couple people were wanting to know the best way to pair program together. They had both done the beginning parts of the Tic-Tac-Toe with AI project (the one I&amp;rsquo;m getting ready to start) and wanted to work on the AI part together. The exact question was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey @******* and I are doing parallel pairing :slightly_smiling_face: what is the best way to go about this, to work on the same repo on separate branches or just copy on paste. She is on IDE, I&amp;rsquo;m on local. Any help muchly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The always awesome and helpful instructor &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cernanb&#34;&gt;Cernan Bernardo&lt;/a&gt; quickly gave a how-to that I knew others could use. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to abbreviate what he said and turn it into a numbered list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab each other&amp;rsquo;s SSH URL for your respective GitHub repos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your respective terminals (local or IDE) you would each run the command &lt;code&gt;git remote add upstream *copy_ssh_url_here*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After running those commands when you run &lt;code&gt;git remote -v&lt;/code&gt; you will see two remotes&amp;hellip;one for your origin which is your respective GitHub repo and one for upstream which is your partner&amp;rsquo;s repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the setup is done, here is the work flow to be done &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; either starts working on the app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;git pull upstream master&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip;this will pull down any code your partner has added to the app and pushed up to their GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on your part of the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip;this will push your new code to YOUR repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that work flow you will each have your code in sync. Just remember to &lt;em&gt;pull before you push&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Questions feel free to ask and I&amp;rsquo;ll ask Cernan ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 20</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-020/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a blog in yesterday. I was struggling with setting up a dual boot of Ubuntu on my Windows 10 laptop. I ran into the problem of not having a large enough partition created and hit a snag. That said everything was installing fine once I got going. I had hoped to just run a persistent USB key and be able to take my dev environment wherever I want but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure that out. Needless to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like writing. In addition, all I did was watch a few lectures last night so there was little to report on. I decided to setup the dual boot because after my intake conversation with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tracypholmes&#34;&gt;Tracy&lt;/a&gt; I was convinced that I should take the time and get my environment setup. It took some time as I had less than 10GB free but by being creative, and using &lt;a href=&#34;https://windirstat.net/&#34;&gt;WinDirStat&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.revouninstaller.com/index.html&#34;&gt;Revo Uninstaller&lt;/a&gt;, I changed that to ~25GB. I decided to make a 15GB partition for Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS but ended up running out of space. I freed up another 5GB today and add ed that to my Linux partition. Overall it was probably about an 8 hour process. I have yet to code in it but I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post in Atom on Ubuntu and I&amp;rsquo;ve cloned down my static site from GitHub using the terminal and I plan to push it as well. One of the biggest changes is that everything just works, in the &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; kind of way. It&amp;rsquo;s nice. Also, Windows doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to go past a 1920x1080 resolution and Ubuntu will go 3200x1800 no problem. My eyes are still adjusting but I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Ubuntu was being a b*tch last night trying to install packages and stuff (programs hanging, etc&amp;hellip;) but today it has worked great. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if having some disk space has helped the OS out but my frustrations have disappeared today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I started my Music Library CLI Project for Object Oriented Ruby! This thing was a beast with 71 tests that I needed to get passing. Luckily I could piece meal it together all based on code I already had written. There was a good amount that had to be written from scratch or completely changed to make the tests pass. However, I had a very strong base of knowledge to work with. I rarely had to Google or hit up Ruby Docs for answers today/tonight. I only hit one MAJOR snag. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a test to pass but everything looked right. I ran the CLI in my terminal and the output was perfect. After 90 minutes of trying different things I finally reached out to what is called a Learn Expert for help. 30 minutes later she was remoted in on my computer and ended up commenting out the test because her and a colleague had both agreed my code worked for the requirements even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t pass the tests. After that I was done in &amp;lt;25 minutes. It took me 7:57 to finish the project from start to finish and I probably could&amp;rsquo;ve shaved over an hour off of that. I haven&amp;rsquo;t refactored at all but the project is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/itzsaga/ruby-music-library-cli-v-000&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the kind of coding day I&amp;rsquo;d like to have every Saturday and Sunday. Maybe 1 more productive hour in there though. Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll start a CLI Tic-Tac-Toe with AI project. I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see how AI is going to be tested and required. Mostly because I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post on Medium about building an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game not too long ago. I thought it would be fun to implement so I&amp;rsquo;ll see if it&amp;rsquo;s possible, maybe on the refactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much new to post about. Just been doing a lot of lecture watching and coding projects currently. Oh, I did learn about the &lt;code&gt;unless&lt;/code&gt; method today from a Learn Expert when a piece of my code wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pass. I&amp;rsquo;m realizing sometimes nobody can explain why we need to use &lt;code&gt;unless&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; to make something work but that&amp;rsquo;s part of it. Some things are just at such a high level of knowing the language that the majority of people won&amp;rsquo;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent today: 9:52&lt;br /&gt;
Time spent total: 92:48&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed today: 2 (and 2 yesterday)&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Day 18</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-018/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2017 23:21:28 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today saw &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of new stuff. I feel like a ton of stuff was introduced and not gone over very deeply but deep enough for me to understand and implement it. In 11 lessons and labs I was exposed to &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; and how to use it, mass assignments, creating and implementing custom errors, gems, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bundler.io/&#34;&gt;bundler&lt;/a&gt;, and basic scraping with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nokogiri.org/&#34;&gt;Nokogiri&lt;/a&gt;. I can tell I was exposed to many things in preparation for the first projects, which can&amp;rsquo;t get here fast enough! At least I say that now, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how I feel when I&amp;rsquo;m at a complete stand still and stuck on one of them lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got stuck for a little while utilizing &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt;. I had a lab with a parent class with a method that simply &lt;code&gt;puts &amp;quot;I can&#39;t remember what it was exactly.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and in the child class I was suppose to use &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; to have that phrase repeated 10 times. So my initial attempt, inside the method was: &lt;code&gt;super.10.times&lt;/code&gt; as I figured I could just call this method but I got &lt;code&gt;NoMethodError: undefined method `super&#39; for #&amp;lt;Enumerator: 10:times&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Hmmm. I did some searching and even called &lt;code&gt;super.class&lt;/code&gt; in pry but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get anymore info. BTW, &lt;code&gt;super.class&lt;/code&gt; literally gave me nothing but a new line in pry to look at, or was that actually something??? So I posed the quesiton in the Slack channel for those who are enrolled in the bootcamp. After a side chain of responses with back and forth I got what I needed for my understanding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;super yields the implementation from the method it’s overriding and returns the last return value or it just returns the last return value.&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/genericlady&#34;&gt;Yianna&lt;/a&gt; (thanks!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I needed. Since it&amp;rsquo;s returning the last value and &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; was just a simple &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; method the return value was &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;. No wonder I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make method calls on it. I also got some way more in depth info that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to digest yet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get stuck on it when I knew just typing out &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; ten times would pass the lab. In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s how Flatiron&amp;rsquo;s solution was coded. This lab was more about understanding how &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; works than how to call methods on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that it was just A LOT of information as I stated at the beginning. Also a chuckle when I found out that &lt;code&gt;~&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is affectionately called a &amp;ldquo;twiddle-wakka&amp;rdquo; for whatever reason. I can figure out the twiddle part but the wakka is stumping me right now. If you know please comment and inform me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few video reviews and then I start projects!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 17</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight was good. I like having a dedicated 3 hour block at night instead of 1 hour in the morning and 2 hours at night. I feel like I can get into a better flow and get more done. I did a study group tonight on a banking lab that I had worked on recently. Took away from it to utilize &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; on pretty much all instance variable references after they have been initialized (created). This is because when we reference the instance variables directly we&amp;rsquo;re cutting out using the macros that &lt;code&gt;attr_accessor&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;attr_reader&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;attr_writer&lt;/code&gt; provide. It is true though that writing code that uses &lt;code&gt;@variable&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;self.variable&lt;/code&gt; will still pass the tests I&amp;rsquo;m working with. I know this because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got through some module lessons and labs once the study group was over. Something to always remember is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a module whose methods you would like to be used in another class as &lt;strong&gt;instance methods&lt;/strong&gt;, then you must &lt;strong&gt;include&lt;/strong&gt; the module.&lt;br /&gt;
If you want a module&amp;rsquo;s methods to be used in another class as &lt;strong&gt;class methods&lt;/strong&gt;, you must &lt;strong&gt;extend&lt;/strong&gt; the module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modules are sweet and I&amp;rsquo;m happy I&amp;rsquo;m going to start using them. Things are getting simpler while they&amp;rsquo;re getting more complex at the same time. There are so many things that have already been figured out in the world of development and slowly they&amp;rsquo;re being introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned tonight that there is a term for the work flow that most people follow when they write code. The work flow being, you have tests that are failing, you write whatever code is needed to pass your tests, you break that ugly code and write cleaner code to pass your tests again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called the &lt;strong&gt;red, green, refactor&lt;/strong&gt; pattern. First tests fail, then you write bad code to get them to pass, then you refactor that bad code into good code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it makes sense that these things have been defined. I&amp;rsquo;m not inventing web development. Just learning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent today: 2:37&lt;br /&gt;
Time spent total: 76:04&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed today: 4&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed total: 268&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 16</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-016/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I completely missed my 6am wake up this morning. I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t reset my alarm from Sunday night. Since I was up until 1am Sunday night I changed my alarm so I could get more sleep. However, thinking about it now having finished tonight at 11pm instead of 10pm I think I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it this way. No matter what I know after 8pm I can be productive. My wife is home and the kids are suppose to be in bed. Whereas in the morning if the baby isn&amp;rsquo;t happy or one of the toddlers decides that 7am is a good time to wake up I&amp;rsquo;m stuck and just lose that coding time. I also think this will be more effective as the labs and projects get more in depth. A longer time will allow me to get in and tackle a problem that only an hour might not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much to report today except I&amp;rsquo;m done with Object Relationship and will be startin Object Architecture tomorrow. I have noticed that things are getting repeated to let them sink and and produce some muscle memory. Even if that muscle is the brain. So there will be a video lecture that will be something being built and being explained as it&amp;rsquo;s built (or be a Q&amp;amp;A while it was happening), then a lesson showing step by step how the same thing is built, then a lab where you do what was just taught verbatim, and do it one more time non-verbatim but the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 17 lessons/labs away from my first projects! That gets me so invigorated to just crush these next few labs and to start building. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to have some stuff to show off and add to my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent today: 2:26&lt;br /&gt;
Time spent total: 73:26&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed today: 4&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Day 15</title>

      <guid>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-015/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 15 and I&amp;rsquo;m still here. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t see it I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;../post/why-software-development&#34;&gt;rather long blog post&lt;/a&gt; today as one of my requirements for Flatiron. Since that took up over an hour and I had a 1:10.00+ video as a lesson I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much done. However, I &lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; have notes from the past couple of days that I never took the time to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on Saturday morning I did a study group with some people and learned a lot. We went through one of the more challenging Procedural Ruby labs. One thing that I had never though to do was put my &lt;code&gt;pry&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;rspec&lt;/code&gt; test file. So I could look at what was going on when everything had already been passed in. I had been putting the &lt;code&gt;pry&lt;/code&gt; in my code and then needing to call the methods above it before I could work on the current problem. I&amp;rsquo;m still not 100% on utilizing &lt;code&gt;pry&lt;/code&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m getting there. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely easier and more useful than IRB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another nifty thing I learned from the study group, which I&amp;rsquo;m still not completely comfortable with but makes sense, is calling methods on &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;. For example we did this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;def all_holidays_with_bbq(holiday_hash)
  holiday_hash.map do |season, holidays|
    holidays.map do |holiday_name, supplies
      supplies.include?(&amp;quot;BBQ&amp;quot;) ? holiday_name : nil
    end
  end.flatten.compact
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way this works is the &lt;code&gt;.flatten.compact&lt;/code&gt; is being called on the return value of &lt;code&gt;holiday_hash.map&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s still settling in my mind and I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it since but I can see where this is useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike who I pair programmed with last night informed me to get a solid understanding of &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; so I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking details notes on things I think are of value. I have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can define methods in which we tell objects to operate on themselves. We do so using the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; keyword, inside the body of an instance method, to refer to the very same object the method is being called on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that definition and it&amp;rsquo;s not too abstract for me to understand what it&amp;rsquo;s saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in one of the lectures Avi stated to try not to use the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; method. He said if you have to use &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re probably doing something wrong and utilizing &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; can cause problems. This is because every method has a return. We should be able to get what we need utilizing higher level methods that will return to us what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for. This makes a lot of sense to me. If I have to use the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; method then I&amp;rsquo;m probably missing something in the code I&amp;rsquo;m returning. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t a hard and fast rule it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and stick to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re keeping up, I didn&amp;rsquo;t look into &lt;code&gt;||=&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;.&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.tap&lt;/code&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 55% through Object Oriented Ruby. I just realized this because I took a glance at my Dashboard which I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing lately. It&amp;rsquo;s moving along but I know it&amp;rsquo;ll take a while once I get to the end. I have some projects to look forward to!

Time spent total: 71:00&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed today: 2&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Why Software Development?</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/why-software-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2017 19:40:42 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/why-software-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So as part of my bootcamp experience Flatiron School requires me to write blog posts. This is a feature that I don&amp;rsquo;t think all bootcamps have but is smart. If I can write about coding then I show a deeper understanding about why I am a job ready developer. We all know that our online presence is part of our &amp;ldquo;resume&amp;rdquo; now as more and more hiring managers are looking at social profiles when making job decisions (even if it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/acquiring-job-candidates/social-media-recruiting-guidelines.aspx&#34;&gt;legal slippery slope&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have assigned topic of, &amp;ldquo;Why did you decide to learn software development?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons I decided to learn software development. Initially, it was because it is the &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; thing to do these days. Demand is &amp;gt; Supply when it comes to people in the tech industry and overall everything we do now is being run by a computer. The Internet of Things (IoT) needs to be programmed. I truly believe that we are moving to a knowledge economy and very soon (on the grand timeline) most repetetive jobs will be replaced by robots, including driving. See a great post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.com/bill-gates-and-elon-musk-just-warned-us-about-the-one-thing-politicians-are-too-scared-to-talk-8db9815fd398&#34;&gt;automation&lt;/a&gt; here. However, people will need to program these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like bootcamps are popping up like crazy as people are making the jump to be developers. The potential pay and benefits are attractive too. We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen images of massive tech companies and their offices where you can take a break from your bean bag workstation and get a massage from the in house masseuse while listening to a private live Billy Joel concert streamed to your company provided bluetooth Beats headphones. Okay, maybe not that extravagent but you get the idea. Or the person who travels the world making 6 figures and all they need is a laptop and internet. Having that remote work freedom at some point is also attractive. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want this life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another driving force is that I was in hospitality. An industry that is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; family friendly. 55+ hour weeks are required for salary managers in most instances and nights, weekends, holidays are the busy time. I kept with it by saying I would &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; be in a high enough job title where I would be doing more strategic planning and thus work a more typical 9-5 schedule. I still believe that to be true. Once a person gets to District Manager or F&amp;amp;B Director you check in on early morning and closing operations occaisonally but you could care less &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the money is counted at close, just that it&amp;rsquo;s counted correctly. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t counted correctly there&amp;rsquo;s always a manager below you to push that to anyways. Something I rarely speak about but through my 10 years in the restaurant business I was laid off 4 times. I was paid severace a couple times and a couple times just collected unemployment but the lack of job stability paired with seeing people 2 years into a tech career making 2x what I was making cemented my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I dabbled while still working my restaurant job. I learned from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.com&#34;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; the most among many other places. Knowing that I could work on a project for hours without taking a break, then stop for the day, then pick it up two days later, then stop, then get stuck the next day and make zero progress, then two days later finish it off, and LOVING that process cemented in me this is something I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that on the intellectual front I would always be challenged and have something to learn when it came to software development. I&amp;rsquo;ll never know it all and that is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how could I make this career transition with a mortgage and 3 kids? In person bootcamps were out of the question. There are two in Nashville (that I know of) and I know people who have graduated from each. First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/&#34;&gt;Nashville Software School&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome program. However, it takes 6 months and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have 6 months of me not working to spare. The other is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theironyard.com/&#34;&gt;The Iron Yard&lt;/a&gt; and while they have a solid reputation the approximately $1000/week tuition was not going to work. In addition, I knew I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be out of pocket completely for 12 weeks, my family life would fall apart. So I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-web-developer-career-course/&#34;&gt;Flatiron School Online Web Developer Program&lt;/a&gt;. Work at your own pace when you have time, job guarantee, a solid curriculum, and high praise from people in the industry I spoke with. The work at your own pace is what sold me the most. I could code before the kids got up and after they went to bed and all weekend long when my wife was home. I could still take care of my kids all day M-F and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay for a nanny. I could potentially finish in 12-15 weeks (they say the curriculum takes ~800 hours) just like a more traditional bootcamp but spend $6000 instead of $10k+. Boom, now to get in. I applied, did some coding, and got accepted (acceptance rate is ~8% so it&amp;rsquo;s competitive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ultimately I decided on software development for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It genuinely interests me outside of doing it as a career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pay ain&amp;rsquo;t bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; schedule so I&amp;rsquo;ll be home for dinner, off on weekends and holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The possibility of working remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I promise a good blog post soon. It&amp;rsquo;s almost 1am after a LONG pair programming session, thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mk-etlinger&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;! We did however figure out a hard lab. I would&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with it for sure. It&amp;rsquo;s not as ambiguous as it could be and we didn&amp;rsquo;t break down our methods as much as we could. However, we got all 15 tests passing and learned some new methods along the way. Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;Dir&lt;/code&gt; class methods. Mike also showed me that there&amp;rsquo;s a solution branch to all of the labs on GitHub which I never knew about. I guess it says something that I&amp;rsquo;ve made it so far so quickly and never looked at a solution. However, there can be knowledge gained from refactoring with new knowledge based on what the school thinks is the best code for the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have &amp;ldquo;homework&amp;rdquo; from Mike too (some things he has learned recently that I&amp;rsquo;m not knowledgable on). Specifically, &lt;code&gt;||=&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.tap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m keeping the update short and sweet tonight. I got &lt;strong&gt;A LOT&lt;/strong&gt; done today. However, my amazing wife has let me code all day and into the night on her birthday. Anything important I took notes on today I&amp;rsquo;ll throw in tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s post. It&amp;rsquo;s time to spend some time with her.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today didn&amp;rsquo;t see much coding. Mostly because the Intro to Object Oriented Ruby is a 1:10.00 video by of Avi teaching the basics of OO Ruby. Which was good. I found that him talking through concepts made them more clear as I worked on just a couple labs afterwards. It also meant that I took some notes on things that I thought were most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes which of course I&amp;rsquo;ll share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; is the implicit receiver of all non-explicit method calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;local variable is variable&lt;br /&gt;
instance variable is @variable&lt;br /&gt;
class variable is @@variable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;attr_reader macro creates getter method&lt;br /&gt;
attr_writer macro creates setter method&lt;br /&gt;
attr_accessor macro creats both setter and getter method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avi also talked about how he personally only used the &lt;code&gt;attr_accessor&lt;/code&gt; macro when he&amp;rsquo;s building stuff. Then after everything is working he takes away abilities depending on what the methods actually are doing. The &lt;code&gt;attr_accessor&lt;/code&gt; macro is the most flexible so it makes sense to use that by default.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was strong work. I finished Procedural Ruby! Now I have Object Oriented Ruby which has final projects and I&amp;rsquo;m done with the Ruby section! I have to say it started to feel like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t making progress but the last two days have reinvigorated me. I know it gets more complex as I go and the projects get bigger and take longer but the groove is starting to fall in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a good amount of time on the second to last lab of Procedural Ruby (there is a small RegEx section that is last). One specific part was hard but I was stoked with the elegant (so I think) answer I was able to come up with. My original plan was NOT this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;# given that holiday_hash looks like this:
# {
#   :winter =&amp;gt; {
#     :christmas =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;Lights&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Wreath&amp;quot;],
#     :new_years =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;Party Hats&amp;quot;]
#   },
#   :summer =&amp;gt; {
#     :fourth_of_july =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;Fireworks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BBQ&amp;quot;]
#   },
#   :fall =&amp;gt; {
#     :thanksgiving =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;Turkey&amp;quot;]
#   },
#   :spring =&amp;gt; {
#     :memorial_day =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;BBQ&amp;quot;]
#   }
# }

def all_supplies_in_holidays(holiday_hash)
  # iterate through holiday_hash and print items such that your readout resembles:
  # Winter:
  #   Christmas: Lights, Wreath
  #   New Years: Party Hats
  # Summer:
  #   Fourth Of July: Fireworks, BBQ
  # etc.
  holiday_hash.each do |season, holiday|
    puts &amp;quot;#{season.to_s.capitalize}:&amp;quot;
    holiday.each do |holiday_name, supplies|
      puts &amp;quot;  #{holiday_name.to_s.split(&amp;quot;_&amp;quot;).collect {|split_holiday_name| split_holiday_name.capitalize}.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)}: #{supplies.join(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;)}&amp;quot;
    end
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could have done a few more lessons tonight but my next lesson has me watching a 1:10:00 long video. It was still a good productive weekday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 10</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-010/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 07:31:22 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-010/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a lot done this morning. Especially after the coffee kicked in. When I started I was definitely not 100% awake. I even did some extra credit on a lab which I typically do not do. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the type to want to score 105 on a test because I aced it &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; the extra credit. I did this one specifically because I knew it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much time as I was writing a generic method for a specific method I had just completed. Basically inserting place holders where the original problem had specific items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first I solved this:&lt;br /&gt;
Advanced: Try building a method &lt;code&gt;swap_elements_from_to&lt;/code&gt; that takes in three arguments, &lt;code&gt;array, index, destination_index&lt;/code&gt;, that will allow you to specify the index of the element you would like to move to a new index.&lt;br /&gt;
Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;def swap_elements_from_to(array, index, new_index)
  array[index], array[new_index] = array[new_index], array[index]
  return array
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I did this:&lt;br /&gt;
Advanced #2: Try writing test coverage for it!
Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;# Question 4 Bonus
describe &#39;swap_elements_from_to&#39; do
  it &#39;swaps elements and allows you to specify the index of the element you would like to move to a new index&#39; do
    expect(swap_elements_from_to([&amp;quot;one&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;two&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;three&amp;quot;], 2, 1)).to eq([&amp;quot;one&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;three&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;two&amp;quot;])
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked!
&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/first_test.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;results_of_first_test&#34; title=&#34;I was psyched when I saw this!&#34; /&gt;
I successfully wrote my first test! I was stoked! I know that I&amp;rsquo;ll have to write my own tests in the future so this small win was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I kept on working, I must say, the fact that I got this as an error is awesome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NoMethodError:
undefined method `starts_with?&#39; for &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;:String
Did you mean?  start_with?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can definitely see why test driven development (TDD) makes so much sense. I had been thinking it was almost like doing double the work but I could&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck there forever because of one letter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 9</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-009/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a slow day. The kids didn&amp;rsquo;t cooperate this morning and I got zero coding done before all three children were awake. That&amp;rsquo;s fine though. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect every day to go perfectly to plan. It was actually a nice refresher day not starting with coding but still getting the rest of my morning routine done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did get in my night time session (minus a few minutes for good night kisses). I had some more in depth labs today and learned a lot about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test&#34;&gt;primality algorithms&lt;/a&gt; when I had the challenge of coding a test to see if a number is prime without using the &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My code works but definitely is not something that would ever get put into production. It is not efficient, at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;def prime?(n)
  if n &amp;lt;= 1
    return false
  elsif n &amp;lt;= 3
    return true
  else (2..n/2).none? do |x|
    n % x == 0
  end
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could make it even more efficient by changing that &lt;code&gt;n/2&lt;/code&gt; to the square root of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get that helper method working. In the end I would want to implement something like what I found online that states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a more efficient method is to test if &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is divisible by 2 or 3, then to check through all the numbers of form &lt;img src=&#34;images/prime6k.svg&#34; alt=&#34;math_formula&#34; /&gt;. This is 3 times as fast as testing all &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is what&amp;rsquo;s happening right now in my solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I won&amp;rsquo;t ever have to do that because &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; is a library that I&amp;rsquo;ll be using in real life. I kind of felt like I did in my college Finance class when the professor told us we had to memorize all the formulas even though she had zero memorized herself because her computer did everything for her at her day job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 8</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-008/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Started the day off with a win before 8 am. I was working on a lab to take an array and return a string with Oxford commas inserted. I finished the lab and had it passing tests then refactored and chopped two lines of code out of it. This made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;
Original code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;def oxford_comma(array)
  if array.length == 1
    return &amp;quot;#{array[0]}&amp;quot;
  elsif array.length == 2
    return array.join(&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;)
  elsif array.length &amp;gt;= 3
    new_last_array_item = &amp;quot;and #{array[-1]}&amp;quot;
    array.pop
    array.push(new_last_array_item)
    return array.join(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;)
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refactored code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;def oxford_comma(array)
  if array.length == 1
    return &amp;quot;#{array[0]}&amp;quot;
  elsif array.length == 2
    return array.join(&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;)
  elsif array.length &amp;gt;= 3
    array[-1] = &amp;quot;and #{array[-1]}&amp;quot;
    return array.join(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;)
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another refactoring win today while the kids were napping. I had the following to accomplish: &amp;ldquo;Write a method called &lt;code&gt;reverse_each_word&lt;/code&gt; that takes in a string argument of a sentence and returns that same sentence with each word reversed in place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;# FIRST METHOD THAT PASSED
def reverse_each_word(array)
  new_array = array.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)
  reversed_array = new_array.each {|x| x.reverse!}
  return reversed_array.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)
end

# FIRST REFACTORED CODE
def reverse_each_word(array)
  new_array = array.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)
  new_array.collect {|x| x.reverse!}
  new_array.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)
end

# FINAL SOLUTION
def reverse_each_word(array)
  array.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;).collect {|x| x.reverse!}.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that I could chain the mehods together since I was calling them all on the same element. Then I also realized that it was going to return automatically from the method so I had no need for the return either. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ruby-doc.org/&#34;&gt;Ruby-Doc&lt;/a&gt; is quickly becoming one of my best friends while working on this Procedural Ruby section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the day of Slack distraction. This can be seen by the number of lessons I completed. However, networking and connecting with other students is important to an extent as well. A few other students and I started down the rabbit hole of health and wellness and biohacking etc&amp;hellip; I was able to share some of the things I do like my morning stretching from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/&#34;&gt;Gymnastic Bodies&lt;/a&gt;, how I drink my coffee cocktail (coffee + grassfed ghee currently), and meditation utilizing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.calm.com/&#34;&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt;. Also how I diffuse essential oils in the office I study/code in and listen to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brain.fm&#34;&gt;Brain.fm&lt;/a&gt; while I code. How I have some &lt;a href=&#34;https://us.foursigmatic.com/collections/all-products/products/instant-lions-mane&#34;&gt;Four Sigmatic Lion&amp;rsquo;s Mane Elixir&lt;/a&gt; on the way from &lt;a href=&#34;http://thrv.me/seth&#34;&gt;Thrive Market&lt;/a&gt; (because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lt;$26 there) and some &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2mZGVPc&#34;&gt;Brain Boost&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent today: 3:17&lt;br /&gt;
Time spent total: 36:43&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed today: 9&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed total: 206&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 7</title>
      <link>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-007/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2017 22:05:48 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itzsaga.github.io/post/day-007/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 3 hours today I finished up the HTML and CSS section. I took one real note today in that 3 hours:&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to &lt;a href=&#34;https://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; as a framework the &lt;code&gt;.col-xs&lt;/code&gt; class never stacks vertically no matter how small the width of the screen gets. Figured that was something I might need to know later. I also learned a lot about how powerful and easy it is to make a site responsive using Bootstrap. I had used Bootstrap in the past but never really understood how to use it more fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spend a chunk of time troubleshooting the custom Learn IDE (built on top of Atom) that Flatiron provides. It has some quirks. Very simple the workflow is this, click a button on the site, the IDE opens, runs a command to fork then clone down a GitHub repo with all the files you need. There were a couple labs that had zero files in them. However, I was building on a previous lab so I had the files I needed. I copied and pasted them into the appropriate place in File Explorer but the IDE wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show them. I had to &amp;ldquo;Import&amp;rdquo; them from within the IDE for it to acknowledge their existence. This was a pain in the ass to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m finally back into Procedural Ruby. Funny thing is I&amp;rsquo;m coming across labs that directly relate to the ones that I did in the Bootcamp Prep course. They&amp;rsquo;re carbon copies in fact. The only difference is that I chose to do the JavaScript Bootcamp Prep and now I&amp;rsquo;m solving problems in Ruby. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting though to see how different languages solve the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I have to give an example. Here&amp;rsquo;s the modified (to make it make more sense for both languages) Deli Counter lab requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the method/function that shows everyone their current place in the line. If there is nobody in line, it should say &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;The line is currently empty.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a method/function that a new customer will use when entering the deli. The method/function should accept two arguments, the array for the current line of people, and a string containing the name of the person wishing to join the line. The method/function should return the person&amp;rsquo;s  name along with their position in line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a method/function which should call out the next person in line and then remove them from the front. If there is nobody in line, it should call out that &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;There is nobody waiting to be served!&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;var katzDeliLine = [];

function currentLine(x) {
    var line = []
    if (x.length === 0) {
      return &amp;quot;The line is currently empty.&amp;quot;
    } else {
      for(var i = 0; i &amp;lt; x.length; i++) {
        line += (i + 1) + &amp;quot;. &amp;quot; + x[i] + &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;
      }
      line = line.slice(0, line.length-2)
      return &amp;quot;The line is currently: &amp;quot; + line
    }
}
function takeANumber(katzDeliLine, name) {
  katzDeliLine.push(name)
  return &amp;quot;Welcome, &amp;quot; + name + &amp;quot;. You are number &amp;quot; + katzDeliLine.length + &amp;quot; in line.&amp;quot;
}
function nowServing(x) {
  if (x.length === 0) {
    return &amp;quot;There is nobody waiting to be served!&amp;quot;
  } else {
    var name = x[0];
    x.splice(0, 1);
    return &amp;quot;Currently serving &amp;quot; + name + &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in Ruby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;katz_deli = []

def line(x)
  line_array = []
  if x.length == 0
    puts &amp;quot;The line is currently empty.&amp;quot;
  else
    x.each.with_index(1) do |name, index|
      line_array.push(&amp;quot;#{index}. #{name}&amp;quot;)
    end
    puts &amp;quot;The line is currently: #{line_array.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)}&amp;quot;
  end
end
def take_a_number(katz_deli, name)
  katz_deli.push(name)
  puts &amp;quot;Welcome, #{name}. You are number #{katz_deli.length} in line.&amp;quot;
end
def now_serving(array)
  if array.empty?
    puts &amp;quot;There is nobody waiting to be served!&amp;quot;
  else
    puts &amp;quot;Currently serving #{array[0]}.&amp;quot;
    array.shift
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small thing I noticed is that it took me 3 less lines of code to do it in Ruby. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not as eloquent in JS as I could be though so I&amp;rsquo;m sure that could be condensed down as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I laughed when I read about the &amp;ldquo;spaceship&amp;rdquo; operator &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; only because it&amp;rsquo;s nicknamed that because it looks like a flying saucer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal note. This schedule I set is rough. Not really on me as much as on the family. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to lock yourself in an at home office for 12+ hours a day 3 days a week with a 2 year old and a 2 month old at home. It takes a lot of work watching over them and when both of us are home it&amp;rsquo;s definitely easier for both of us to contribute. I still think next week I can break the 45 hour mark for the amount of time I get to work on coding. I had planned on 52 hours a week which would have me done with the ~800 hours of curriculum in 13 weeks. Since I pay by the month if that gets pushed a couple weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll still be done &amp;lt;16 weeks and not pay for that 5th month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent today: 5:52&lt;br /&gt;
Time spent total: 33:26&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons completed today: 32&lt;/p&gt;
