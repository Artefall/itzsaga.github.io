      <description>We had our June meetup today and it was good. A small group but we solved some problems together and we talked shop some. Specifically, Leland brought up the scope of the projects. How it&amp;rsquo;s easy to go off on tangents and hours later be so far away from what you initially started working on. We shared some tips on how to stay focused and keep within the scope of the project.</description>

      <description>So today Dave Harned and I hosted the monthly freeCodeCamp Nashville Meetup. There were 8 of us there and it was good to see new and &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; faces. I think we&amp;rsquo;re starting to build more of a core group that will consistently attend the meetup. With that we&amp;rsquo;ve started exploring some other options for larger meetup locations. The library is nice but the wifi is awfully slow and that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big downside considering what we&amp;rsquo;re meeting for.</description>
