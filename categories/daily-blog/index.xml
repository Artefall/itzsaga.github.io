      <description>Feeling great about today. The things that a struggled with the most I ended up cementing (it&amp;rsquo;s not dry yet) into my brain. The Learn community is awesome I must say. After 2 hours with a Learn Expert (basically a TA) we were both sufficiently stumped. I dropped a note into the students Slack channel and &amp;lt;20 minutes it was figured out by the group. So you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering what it was&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It felt so good to spend almost the entire day coding. I missed it. My progress was VERY SLOW at times (or so it felt). Things like the :source option in Active Record were foreign and not really taught but needed to solve a large lab I was working on starting first thing this morning. Luckily I have access to some awesome help. Here&amp;rsquo;s one conversation I had today:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be very happy to code during the day tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tired these last few nights during my target of 8pm - 11pm coding time. I just took a second, leaned back in my chair so my head could rest on the chair back, closed my eyes to think about a problem, and almost fell asleep.
Learned about some Active Record Callbacks of which there are many more than I would have imagined:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted tonight. Been working mainly on more Active Record associations. More complex ones than before I would assume to get in practice for later labs. Foreign key and Class Name Active Record class methods to be exact if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some light reading lol.
I attended an Alumni career fair at my alma matter Belmont University today which was interesting. I never attended one as an undergrad so the whole, drop your resume off on as many tables as possible, was lost on me.</description>

      <description>Watching Avi build out the TodoMVC is an interesting thing and I&amp;rsquo;m happy I get to do it as part of my curriculum and showing what Rails does. That was the bulk of the new work I did tonight. Something that I ran into during my Sinatra project was getting all my associations to work properly. I had issues because of what I now know is called the Active Record Inflector.</description>

      <description>Not much going on but completing a couple larger labs tonight. One significant things that halted me for a while was an issue in my strong params. I had:
def song_params params.permit(:title, :released, :release_year, :artist_name, :genre) end  Which looks really nice but doesn&amp;rsquo;t take into account that I&amp;rsquo;m using form_for and thus my submitted data is actually a nested hash. A quick change to:
def song_params params.require(:song).permit(:title, :released, :release_year, :artist_name, :genre) end  Had me moving along again.</description>

      <description>I can happily say that I got zero, yes 0 coding done today. Well I guess I got a little in during my 45 minutes Sinatra Project review this morning. Which was a great review btw.
 Hi Seth,
Awesome job on your Sinatra Project!! You did a great job, and I really appreciate your work on the Active Record relationships and your clean and concise code. As you move forward these practices will help you a lot.</description>

      <description>So that intense lab I was talking about yesterday&amp;hellip; it took no time at all because of Rails. It was AWESOME. One of the things I learned today that is going to make life easier and ensure DRY.
# example_controller.rb # Insert at top of controller before_action :set_example, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy] # Insert at end of controller private def set_example @example = Example.find(params[:id]) end  So up until now to access a db object as an instance variable I&amp;rsquo;ve used the ID passed in from the URL or form and then done a lookup to set the instance variable.</description>

      <description>It was a LONG day on my computer. Ubuntu decided to suggest I update to 16.10 and I did. Well that just started a string of issues that ended up in me reinstalling 16.04.2 LTS. I lost my entire morning and early afternoon to this process before I could get coding today. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I could&amp;rsquo;ve figured it out in time but time is something that is precious and I really had no need to upgrade.</description>

      <description>Continuing with Rails. I now have 5 pages in my Cast Iron Design notebook. Something cool that I learned today:
&amp;lt;!-- How link_to works --&amp;gt; &amp;lt;% @posts.each do |post| %&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%= link_to post.title, post_path(post) %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- Creates the following HTML --&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/posts/1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;My Title&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  Which is pretty sweet considering how I was doing it in Sinatra. Something else that&amp;rsquo;s pretty sweet is that when we code post_path(post) Rails is smart enough to know that it needs to use the id attribute of the post object we just passed in.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is tonight but I just can&amp;rsquo;t get into the groove. I&amp;rsquo;m steady distracted and not focused. And no it&amp;rsquo;s not because of the date, you know you were thinking it. Ugh. At least it&amp;rsquo;s on a &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo; day and I did attend a meetup tonight so I did something beneficial to my coding journey that took a few hours of my evening. I am a few pages into one of my notebooks though so I can say that&amp;rsquo;s good.</description>

      <description>Today I started Rails in all it&amp;rsquo;s glory. This will be my first full on framework that I get to work with. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen though it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that has so much the key will be to stay focused on what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have Rails do instead of everything it can do. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think that after this large section Career Services will be reaching out to me to start that process while I finished up the JS part of the program.</description>

      <description>MY SINATRA PORTFOLIO PROJECT IS DONE!!!
You can say I&amp;rsquo;m pretty stoked. This blog is part of the requirements though so get ready :-). Actually, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take enough notes to really get into the code in this blog. I did hit some solid stumbling blocks and there is some major refactoring of code needing to happen but I&amp;rsquo;m overall pretty happy. A large part of the time I spent was making the app look good utilizing Bootstrap.</description>

      <description>Not much to report today. I got some free passes from being a member of American Mensa to see Gifted. So the wife and I went to see that tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s a good movie and I recommend it.
I finished up the controller and views for one part of my Sinatra project. It&amp;rsquo;s coming along nicely. Now that I have this done I don&amp;rsquo;t think the next two controllers and associated views will take as long.</description>

      <description>I decided to take the weekend off and enjoy the Easter holiday with the family. I had been going hard for almost 7 straight weeks. Back at it tomorrow. I also ordered my Code &amp;amp; Quill Origin this weekend. Looking forward to getting my notebooks just in time to take notes on Rails.

      <description>So about that not being fancy that I talked about last night. I took a good chunk of time today and figured out how to implement Bootstrap in my portfolio project. I figured this was my first web app and should probably look somewhat nice. I have a navbar that changes if you&amp;rsquo;re logged in or not and then I&amp;rsquo;m using the form and typography stylings. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely taking me longer to write my forms out and I&amp;rsquo;m making sure my app actually will look good so that is taking more time as well.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late so I&amp;rsquo;ll be brief. I crushed my project tonight and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to start my Sinatra portfolio project tomorrow. I think I can have an ugly version (desktown down design, raw forms, no nav bar or footer) done tomorrow at some point and then leave it alone until after my project review with an instructor. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes. The requirements are:
 Build an MVC Sinatra Application.</description>

      <description>Taking it easy tonight. I have to get some work done for Gift of Adoption Fund, the non-profit I volunteer on the board for here in TN. Shameless plug, Like our Facebook Page please. I finished up the NYC lab in &amp;lt;30 minutes. The second controller and views were much more simple. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to refactor my code yet. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think a helper methods are needed as I didn&amp;rsquo;t use that code anywhere in my other controller.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on a killer roll right now blowing through this NYC lab. Built my 3 tables and 1 JOIN table migrations. Built out the associated models. Built out all the views and one controller. Have one controller and it&amp;rsquo;s views left now. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have kids that were going to wake me up between 6:30am and 8:00am I&amp;rsquo;d finish it up. I think it&amp;rsquo;ll take me maybe 30 more mins (mostly because A LOT of it is going to be similar to the controller &amp;amp; views I just built) but sleep is needed.</description>

      <description>Got a large lab done tonight. Right on schedule. I was done 2 minutes after 11pm. I basically took the Music Library CLI app that I made earlier in the curriculum and turned it into a much more user friendly Sinatra MVC web app. The final code can be found here. The biggest challenge I had was setting up my databases and models. Actually, just with the JOIN table. However, I know the more I do this the easier it will get.</description>

      <description>Today was the day of road blocks. I spent probably 3 hours working with Learn Experts on problems. For the most part these were dev environment issues or weird test issues and not working through my code and learning new things. I did learn some things about debugging though. I learned to check my Gemfile because if a gem is missing weird things happen. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I was able to run shotgun without having the gem in the Gemfile but it worked and then I got odd errors in my browser.</description>

      <description>I moved through a lot of curriculum today. However, I really want to hit the goal I set two weeks ago and I&amp;rsquo;m on the cusp of it! I had 21 lessons/labs to go for my goal when I checked early in the day. So I set a goal of 11 more today (I had laready finished 2) and finish tomorrow. I missed it by one only because it&amp;rsquo;s late and I hit an hour and a half review lecture.</description>

      <description>So nested forms aren&amp;rsquo;t as bad as I thought they would be. I guess it helps that I had some good teaching before I got into it. I think I had the longest video yet to watch tonight and that took up most of the time once I finished the lab I started last night. The lab I&amp;rsquo;m on seems to be more of the same just getting the concept to stick with a more in depth nested form.</description>

      <description>I only got a little bit of coding done tonight by choice. I think I&amp;rsquo;m procrastinating on this nested hash forms lab because nested hashes can get confusing. I started it though and just got sidetracked. I need to stay focused. I worked on getting RubyMine installed to see what it&amp;rsquo;s about and my computer froze. After that I just gave up on coding tonight. I guess I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very motivated if that&amp;rsquo;s all it took lol.</description>

      <description>Sinatra, and models, and views, and controllers, and erb, OH MY! Tonight I kept building small things with Sinatra. I&amp;rsquo;ve realized exactly how the MVC system works and what each piece does. The model is all the ruby classes I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing. The view is a mixture of HTML and Ruby that the user sees in their browser. The controller takes the user input and returns the data that has been crunched by the models.</description>

      <description>Sinatra is moving along and clicking well. I have this fear after being somewhat cocky in last night&amp;rsquo;s post that the spirits of those Senior Devs before me are going to jump into my learning and humble me some. If so, not today. It&amp;rsquo;s all making sense the first time through. I think this is because there&amp;rsquo;s very little new logic. It&amp;rsquo;s just where to put that login in regards to models, views and controllers.</description>

      <description>I got a late start tonight :-( so I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend as much time as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked. However, I did learn that my wife did not know that it was not a good idea to try and peel a cantaloupe with a chef&amp;rsquo;s knife. Yeah, so after helping her wrap a sliced finger in a paper towel cantaloupe slicing duty fell on me. Then I spilled my tea all over my desk because one of my children (I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the 2 year old) had wedged my chair under my desk.</description>

      <description>Progress progress progress. I&amp;rsquo;m moving along. I watched the last ActiveRecord video then finished up the Rack section. Learning the lowest level of how Rails runs a webserver. There is a granular procedure that&amp;rsquo;s happening and it was explained. First we learn basic Rack, then Sinatra abstracts a little bit more, then Rails abstracts even more. So when things do break, because they will, there is an understanding of what&amp;rsquo;s actually going on to fix it.</description>

      <description>It was a good day in the coding world of Seth. I started out completing a decent size lab in the ActiveRecord section. Then headed off to the Free Code Camp Nashville meetup. It was a great meetup where Jason Gresalfi presented on how he had created a Chrome extension. The repo for his extentsion can be found here and you can find it in the Chrome webstore here. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; chrome extensions can be.</description>

      <description>I started Active Record tonight and I&amp;rsquo;m stoked. Mostly because a lot of the work has already been done and now I can just use the magic that is provided to me. I think I have always had the basic understanding that there are libraries that will be doing a lot of the things I have been learning for me. That is why when I get stuck on things but can still complete projects and labs I just push through.</description>

      <description>Almost 3 hours of review vidoes watched tonight. On thing that I think can be very useful to all. A double bang !! converts an object to it&amp;rsquo;s truthy value. For example:
seth@seth-u:~$ irb 2.4.0 :001 &amp;gt; 1 =&amp;gt; 1 2.4.0 :002 &amp;gt; !1 =&amp;gt; false 2.4.0 :003 &amp;gt; !!1 =&amp;gt; true  So the return value of 1 is 1 we know 1 has a boolean value of true. So !</description>

      <description>Tonight I had my CLI Gem Project review with one of the instructors. It was pretty cool. I talked through my project from start to almost finish (I realized after we finished we never went over the last method that takes user input to either start over or end). We added another class and refactored some code to make my gen more extensible and flexible in the future. While they&amp;rsquo;re not official tasks I set a couple new features I want to add to the gem.</description>

      <description>Tonight I was able to get much deeper into the ORM section. The curriculum returned to the lesson then lab format that is more familiar. Learn how to build a few methods and why you build them that way. Then immediately do it locally. Then the next lesson builds on the last. This is much easier to make progress through and I feel much better about databases now. Well, I feel much better about how they integrate and how Ruby wraps them.</description>

      <description>Polished off the SQL tonight and I have to say it was more in depth than I thought it would be. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that is hard to visualize being new to it. When the tables are laid out in a grid it all makes sense but just trying to do it all in your head is confusing, even for me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I was doing it every day it would be much more intuitive but right now I&amp;rsquo;m still a little fuzzy on keeping track of the data I&amp;rsquo;m looking for through multiple JOINS.</description>

      <description>Today started with multiple review videos on the CLI Gem Project. I also was able to schedule my project review for Wednesday night. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to some one-on-one time with an instructor talking through my code. The project states:
 BE PREPARED TO:
1. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. We&amp;rsquo;re making sure you wrote it and understand how it works, nothing else. 10-20 minutes 2. Refactor code.</description>

      <description>So I went later than I wanted to tonight, but I was on a roll. I would have finished much earlier but I spent 2.5 hours today at a developer meetup. It was interesting as I&amp;rsquo;ve only been to one other so far. It was good to meet some people and start putting real people to the dev community in Nashville. I did find out that basically nobody is learning/using Ruby (at least at this meetup).</description>

      <description>Tonight I made some good progress on my CLI project. I finished watching Avi&amp;rsquo;s video on the project and it helped A LOT. It was long so I decided to just complete the basic stub of my project and leave it at that for tonight. I really like working with fake placeholder data for as long as possible. This way it&amp;rsquo;ll all hopefully just work when real data is passed in.</description>

      <description>So tonight I started my CLI Gem project. This one is going to be in my portfolio and has A LOT more to it. Okay, well maybe not a lot more but it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m starting from scratch to build something. Luckily, I&amp;rsquo;m not left out to dry and there is a how-to that&amp;rsquo;s over an hour long that Avi did. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ll need to do and I&amp;rsquo;ll run into problems along the way but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a good resource to start with.</description>

      <description>yawn it&amp;rsquo;s been a long day. My 3 month old was up early today. Either way, I got my scraping project done tonight. Nokogiri can be quite particular about the things you use to select content. Turned out I was pretty much there and just needed to change how I was accessing the info I needed.
Attended a Study Group tonight which taught me something very important. When using pry inside a loop when you enter exit into the pry prompt it runs the next loop.</description>

      <description>So working on my scraping project. It&amp;rsquo;s hurting my head. Scraping is no fun to figure out. What I&amp;rsquo;m stuck on right now is iterating. When I have some time tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m going to work on completely understanding iterating when scraping. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m looking at currently:

      <description>About 10 minutes before I was suppose to get to my computer the power went out in my subdivision. I quickly realized that while I had setup flashlights in strategic locations in our apartment, when we moved into our house I never did the same. My wife and I both did not have our phones on us and it was DARK. Needless to say I closed the baby gate at the top of the stairs to keep the little ones safe and made my way to the kitchen where I knew a flashlight was.</description>

      <description>Another productive project day means, not much to talk about! I got through all the tests that I needed to for my Tic-Tac-Toe with AI project. I started trying to build out my &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t get very far. I know I need to start simple so I decided to just attempt the computer making random moves. I tried to implement the following work flow: 1. Get the current board array (although this should be passed in by default).</description>

      <description>Sorry I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a blog in yesterday. I was struggling with setting up a dual boot of Ubuntu on my Windows 10 laptop. I ran into the problem of not having a large enough partition created and hit a snag. That said everything was installing fine once I got going. I had hoped to just run a persistent USB key and be able to take my dev environment wherever I want but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure that out.</description>

      <description>Today saw a lot of new stuff. I feel like a ton of stuff was introduced and not gone over very deeply but deep enough for me to understand and implement it. In 11 lessons and labs I was exposed to super and how to use it, mass assignments, creating and implementing custom errors, gems, bundler, and basic scraping with Nokogiri. I can tell I was exposed to many things in preparation for the first projects, which can&amp;rsquo;t get here fast enough!</description>

      <description>Tonight was good. I like having a dedicated 3 hour block at night instead of 1 hour in the morning and 2 hours at night. I feel like I can get into a better flow and get more done. I did a study group tonight on a banking lab that I had worked on recently. Took away from it to utilize self on pretty much all instance variable references after they have been initialized (created).</description>

      <description>I completely missed my 6am wake up this morning. I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t reset my alarm from Sunday night. Since I was up until 1am Sunday night I changed my alarm so I could get more sleep. However, thinking about it now having finished tonight at 11pm instead of 10pm I think I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it this way. No matter what I know after 8pm I can be productive. My wife is home and the kids are suppose to be in bed.</description>

      <description>Day 15 and I&amp;rsquo;m still here. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t see it I wrote a rather long blog post today as one of my requirements for Flatiron. Since that took up over an hour and I had a 1:10.00+ video as a lesson I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much done. However, I DO have notes from the past couple of days that I never took the time to share.
So on Saturday morning I did a study group with some people and learned a lot.</description>

      <description>I promise a good blog post soon. It&amp;rsquo;s almost 1am after a LONG pair programming session, thanks Mike! We did however figure out a hard lab. I would&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with it for sure. It&amp;rsquo;s not as ambiguous as it could be and we didn&amp;rsquo;t break down our methods as much as we could. However, we got all 15 tests passing and learned some new methods along the way. Specifically, the Dir class methods.</description>

      <description>Today didn&amp;rsquo;t see much coding. Mostly because the Intro to Object Oriented Ruby is a 1:10.00 video by of Avi teaching the basics of OO Ruby. Which was good. I found that him talking through concepts made them more clear as I worked on just a couple labs afterwards. It also meant that I took some notes on things that I thought were most important.
Notes which of course I&amp;rsquo;ll share:</description>

      <description>Today was strong work. I finished Procedural Ruby! Now I have Object Oriented Ruby which has final projects and I&amp;rsquo;m done with the Ruby section! I have to say it started to feel like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t making progress but the last two days have reinvigorated me. I know it gets more complex as I go and the projects get bigger and take longer but the groove is starting to fall in place.</description>

      <description>I got a lot done this morning. Especially after the coffee kicked in. When I started I was definitely not 100% awake. I even did some extra credit on a lab which I typically do not do. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the type to want to score 105 on a test because I aced it AND the extra credit. I did this one specifically because I knew it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much time as I was writing a generic method for a specific method I had just completed.</description>

      <description>Today was a slow day. The kids didn&amp;rsquo;t cooperate this morning and I got zero coding done before all three children were awake. That&amp;rsquo;s fine though. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect every day to go perfectly to plan. It was actually a nice refresher day not starting with coding but still getting the rest of my morning routine done.
I did get in my night time session (minus a few minutes for good night kisses).</description>

      <description>Started the day off with a win before 8 am. I was working on a lab to take an array and return a string with Oxford commas inserted. I finished the lab and had it passing tests then refactored and chopped two lines of code out of it. This made me happy.
Original code:
def oxford_comma(array) if array.length == 1 return &amp;quot;#{array[0]}&amp;quot; elsif array.length == 2 return array.join(&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;) elsif array.</description>

      <description>After 3 hours today I finished up the HTML and CSS section. I took one real note today in that 3 hours:
When it comes to Bootstrap as a framework the .col-xs class never stacks vertically no matter how small the width of the screen gets. Figured that was something I might need to know later. I also learned a lot about how powerful and easy it is to make a site responsive using Bootstrap.</description>

      <description>It was a LONG day of HTML &amp;amp; CSS and I&amp;rsquo;m still not done with this section. It&amp;rsquo;s okay though. While a lot of it has been review a lot of it has not as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a ton about responsive web design. Especially Mobile Up (Mobile First) design and how to utilize @media queries in CSS to set break points. As well as some best practices doing design of this type.</description>

      <description>Today had a rough start. We decided to start potty training today and my wife and I were not on the same page about what that would look like in terms of the amount of coding I would get done today. Thankfully we got things moving pretty smoothly about noon. I then proceeded to complete my first part of the Intro to Ruby curriculum! I now have a functioning CLI Tic Tac Toe game built in Ruby.</description>

      <description>Today was no longer than the first few but definitely felt like it was. I learned the hard lesson that with this schedule I actually have to go to sleep when I schedule it. I stayed up late last night but still stuck to my 6 am wake-up call. Needless to say my last 30 minutes of coding tonight was not good and I couldn’t make progress like I know I can.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to announce what day it is anymore, lol. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got my morning routine down now. Alarms go off at 6 am and I&amp;rsquo;m out of bed by 6:15 am typically. Coffee is done brewing by the time I get downstairs. Feed the dog and make my coffee (ghee is my only additive right now but I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to Bulletproof Coffee at some point using Brain Octane™ Oil).</description>

      <description>Another day, more code. However, now I have the full bootcamp track! This is what I was waiting for: I also started tracking my time using Toggl solely because I was interested in exactly how long this bootcamp is going to take. Well, that and yesterday my wife asked me how much time I got to spend on school so now I&amp;rsquo;ll know. Started on some Ruby this morning and also learned that career placement starts when 75% of the curriculum is done (after Rails is complete).</description>

      <description>Day 1 is finally upon me! I&amp;rsquo;ve got my setup ready as of last night after making a road trip to IKEA in Memphis, TN. After the price of gas I probably could have gotten a desk, chair, and that plastic thing you put on the floor for the same price here in Nashville but why not go to IKEA? I also know people are crazy for IKEA stuff so if we end up getting rid of this stuff someone will buy it quick!</description>
